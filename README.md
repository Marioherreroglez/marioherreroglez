Welcome to my Github page! I am a physicist and data scientist with a passion for exploring the intersection of quantum information and artificial intelligence. My research interests include quantum computing, data assimilation, artificial intelligence and big data analysis. I am always on the lookout for new and interesting projects that allow me to apply my skills and knowledge in these areas. Whether it's developing algorithms for quantum information processing, integrating data from multiple sources to improve our understanding of a system, or analyzing large datasets to extract insights and make data-driven decisions, I am always eager to learn and grow as a researcher and developer. Thank you for visiting my page and I hope you find something here that piques your interest!
